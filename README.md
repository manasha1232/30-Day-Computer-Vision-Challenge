# 30-Day-Computer-Vision-Challenge
30-Day Computer Vision Challenge: Daily hands-on projects to learn and practice computer vision concepts using Python, OpenCV, and related libraries. Each day focuses on a different task, from image processing and object detection to deep learning applications. Includes code, sample images, results, and reference resources

# 30-Day Computer Vision Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains my **30-day computer vision challenge**, designed to improve practical skills in computer vision and deep learning. Each day focuses on a specific task or concept, providing code, input samples, output results, and reference resources.

## Objective
- Learn key computer vision techniques step by step.
- Build small projects every day to reinforce understanding.
- Maintain a structured repository for future reference and portfolio showcase.

## Key Features
- Daily folders (Day-01 to Day-30) with:
  - `code.py` or notebooks
  - `images/` – input images for testing
  - `results/` – output images, videos, or plots
  - `resources/` – references, datasets, PDFs, or helpful links
  - `README.md` – explanation of the day’s challenge
- Main `README.md` with challenge overview and table of contents
- `requirements.txt` with all dependencies for easy setup

## Technologies Used
- Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Optional: TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning tasks
